Pre-Compiled software is for offical hardware:

 - [Generation 2 WiFi ESP32 ebay sold hardware (with or without MELCloud port)](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/326373657740?var=515493740627)
 - [ESP32 Ethernet ebay sold hardware](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/326373657740?var=515493740625)
- [Generation 1 WiFi ESP8266 ebay sold hardware (No longer available)](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/325967595655)


You can bring your own, compile in Arduino or flash the same hardware above with pre-compiled files.
